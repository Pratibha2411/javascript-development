// for loop = repeat some code a certain amount of time, while loop are for loop works almost similar except the fact that while loops are more effecient for infinite consitions and for loops are for certain amount of time
    // 3 statements in for loop are: declaraion or assignment of variable statement then condition statement then increment or decrement statement
    // for example: for(let i = 0; i < 10; i +=1)
    // i is scope based variable: i aint useful out of this for loop.

for (let i = 20; i > 0; i-= 2){
    console.log(i);
}
console.log("Happy Birthday");
console.log("Variable i is giving error", i);
